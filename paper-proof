Query 1: The cities of the Carnegie Mellon University (i.e. Pittsburgh) and
  of the Technische Universität München (i.e. Munich) are correct.

Query 2: Jeremy Avigad's email is correct.

Query 3: The journal Logical Methods in Computer Science (LMCS) is a purely
  electronical journal. There is no published book, hence no page numbers.

Some lines in the listings aparently changed length, so new line breaks were
introduced. We suggest the following changes:

l 492 change the last word on the line from "space" to "set".

l 456 / 457: Linebreak directly after the left-right-arrow <->, and an additional
indentation:

  shows "integrable M f ←→
    f ∈ M →_M borel ∧ ...

l533 / 534: Linebreak directly after the equality symbol =, and an additional
indentation:
  "normal_density μ σ x =
    1 / sqrt (2 * pi * σ 2 ) * exp (-(x - μ ) 2 / (2 * σ 2 ))"

l639 / 640: Linebreak directly after the implication symbol ==>, and an
additional indentation:

  shows "integrable M f =⇒
    norm (LINT x|M. f x) ≤ (LINT x|M. norm (f x))

l782: To avoid the dangling "1", change "=" to "is equal to".

l784 / 785: Linebreak between the colon and the quotation mark ", and an
additional indentation:

lemma ( in real_distribution) cdf_lim_at_top_prob:
  "(cdf M −−−→ 1) at_top"

l931 / 932: Linebreak between the colon and the quotation mark ", and an
additional indentation:

lemma ( in real_distribution) continuous_char:
  "continuous (at t) (char M)"

l953 / 954: Linebreak between the colon and the quotation mark ", and an
additional indentation:

  have [measurable]:
    "random_variable borel X1" "random_variable borel X2"

l991 / 992: Linebreak between last two quotation marks ", and an
additional indentation:

    and "integrable M X" "integrable M ( λ x. (X x)ˆ2)"
      "expectation X = 0"


l1009: Linebreak between "lborel" and "("

l1108 / 1109: Linebreak directly after the last conjunction symbol, and an
additional indentation:

  shows " ∃ r M. subseq r ∧ real_distribution M ∧
    weak_conv_m (μ ◦ s ◦ r) M"

l1348: remove empty line

l1349: An additional identation for `std_normal_distribution"`

l1351: linebreak before the "and".

l1359 / 1360: Linebreak between the second comma and `rule`, and additional
indentation:

  by (subst X_distrib [symmetric, of 0],
    rule real_distribution_distr, simp)

l1371 / 1372: Linebreak after the less-than symbol ≤, and additional indentation:

    cmod ( φ n t - (1 + (-(tˆ2) / 2) / n)ˆn) ≤
      t 2 / (6 * σ 2 ) * ?I n t"


l1414 / 1415 / 1416: Linebreak between `of_real_diff` and `simp:`:

by (auto intro!: norm_power_diff μ .cmod_char_le_1 abs_leI
         simp del: of_real_diff
         simp: of_real_diff[symmetric] divide_le_eq)


l1440: Indent `w = ` one more than `by` from line 1439.

l1447: Line break between `isCont_tendsto_compose` and `[OF ...`, indent
`[OF..` in the next line one more than `auto` from line 1448.

l1488: Indent `for n` the same as `unfolding` in line 1489.
