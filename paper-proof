Some lines in the listings aparently changed length, so new line breaks were
introduced. We request the following changes:

l 492 change the last word on the line from "space" to "set".

l 456 / 457: Linebreak directly after the left-right-arrow <->, and an additional
indentation:

  shows "integrable M f ←→
    f ∈ M →_M borel ∧ ...

l533 / 534: Linebreak directly after the equality symbol =, and an additional
indentation:
  "normal_density μ σ x =
    1 / sqrt (2 * pi * σ 2 ) * exp (-(x - μ ) 2 / (2 * σ 2 ))"

l639 / 640: Linebreak directly after the implication symbol ==>, and an
additional indentation:

  shows "integrable M f =⇒
    norm (LINT x|M. f x) ≤ (LINT x|M. norm (f x))

l782: To avoid the dangling "1", change "=" to "is equal to".

l784 / 785: Linebreak between the colon and the quotation mark ", and an
additional indentation:

lemma ( in real_distribution) cdf_lim_at_top_prob:
  "(cdf M −−−→ 1) at_top"

l931 / 932: Linebreak between the colon and the quotation mark ", and an
additional indentation:

lemma ( in real_distribution) continuous_char:
  "continuous (at t) (char M)"

l953 / 954: Linebreak between the colon and the quotation mark ", and an
additional indentation:

  have [measurable]:
    "random_variable borel X1" "random_variable borel X2"

l991 / 992: Linebreak between last two quotation marks ", and an
additional indentation:

    and "integrable M X" "integrable M ( λ x. (X x)ˆ2)"
      "expectation X = 0"


l1009: Linebreak between "lborel" and "("

l1108 / 1109: Linebreak directly after the last conjunction symbol, and an
additional indentation:

  shows " ∃ r M. subseq r ∧ real_distribution M ∧
    weak_conv_m (μ ◦ s ◦ r) M"

l1348: remove empty line

l1349: An additional identation for `std_normal_distribution"`

l1351: linebreak before the "and".

l1359 / 1360: Linebreak between the second comma and `rule`, and additional
indentation:

  by (subst X_distrib [symmetric, of 0],
    rule real_distribution_distr, simp)

l1371 / 1372: Linebreak after the less-than symbol ≤, and additional indentation:

    cmod ( φ n t - (1 + (-(tˆ2) / 2) / n)ˆn) ≤
      t 2 / (6 * σ 2 ) * ?I n t"


l1414 / 1415 / 1416: Linebreak between `of_real_diff` and `simp:`:

by (auto intro!: norm_power_diff μ .cmod_char_le_1 abs_leI
         simp del: of_real_diff
         simp: of_real_diff[symmetric] divide_le_eq)


l1440: Indent `w = ` one more than `by` from line 1439.

l1447: Line break between `isCont_tendsto_compose` and `[OF ...`, indent
`[OF..` in the next line one more than `auto` from line 1448.

l1488: Indent `for n` the same as `unfolding` in line 1489.

l1499: Please add a refernece to arXiv. The arXiv publication data is below.
