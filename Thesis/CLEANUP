Library_Misc:

-Rename this file, and perhaps break it into different pieces for different libraries.

-Determine whether results are useful.

-Determine whether theorem statements work well with established style, and change as needed.

-Consider whether proof is readable.

-Think about theorem names and where theorems should be placed.

Si:

-Rewrite tactical proofs more declaratively.

-Look in integration library for tools to improve proofs.

-Give calculation lemmata more descriptive names.

Distribution_Functions:

-Look over proofs and rewrite tactical parts more declaritively.

Helly_Selection: Same

Weak_Convergence: Same, and put pieces which should be put into library into Library_Misc

Levy: Same, refactor proof of inversion theorem especially.

Characteristic_Functions:

-Same as above.

-Consider how proofs could be improved with new integration library.

-Give theorems more descriptive names.

Central_Limit_Theorem: Same as for Distribution_Functions.
